State of Data Bandejão 1S/2025

Problem I want to Solve:
Here at State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), we usually have lunch and dinner at uni's restaurant, called "Bandejão".

Given that, I want to know what to expect from the daily menu each day and if a meal I like will be served or not.

Questions:
- How predictable is today’s menu based on the past?
- How often are the same dishes repeated across days?
- How often do we have Feijoada (brazilian dish)?
- How often do we have Chicken?
- Are meals lighter on Mondays and heavier on Fridays?
- Do hot or rainy days correlate with lighter meals?
- Which dishes tend to appear together?
- Which sauces appear more?
- What’s the average carbon footprint of daily meals?
